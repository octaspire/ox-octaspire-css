#+TITLE: ox-octaspire-css

* About

=ox-octaspire-css= is a CSS for Emacs Org mode HTML exports.
It should be usable with any Org HTML export, but it is designed
specially for =ox-base64-html= exported HTML5 files.

* Usage

=style.css= can be used as it is, without doing anything.
=file-style.org= can be used in an Org document like this:

#+begin_src org
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/octaspire/css/file-style.org
#+end_src

If we want to generate fully stand alone HTML file, then
we can use =base64-style.org=. It can be generated by issuing
command:

#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

The generated =base64-style.org= can be used like this:

#+begin_src org
#+SETUPFILE: ~/.config/emacs/octaspire/css/base64-style.org
#+end_src
